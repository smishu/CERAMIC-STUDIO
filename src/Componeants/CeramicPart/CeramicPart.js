                <h2>Global Outlook of Ceramics</h2>
                <p> <span>The global market of ceramic products, according to a recent report, is predicted to be worth USD 407.72 billion by 2025.</span>The key drivers of this market growth are basically the emergence of various applications of “advanced ceramics”. For example, use of advanced ceramics in 3D printing technology and dental implants. Raw materials and energy are the major constituents of the manufacturing cost structure of ceramics. Raw materials stand at 22%, followed by energy which is responsible for  21%, labor and overhead costs at 16% and 13% respectively. The remaining percentage, 28% is attributed to transport, distribution and depreciation.[9] Manufacturers face constant criticism over energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission which is why the global market is on the pursuit of more sustainable methods of production. </p>
                <p>The traditional ceramics product had the highest share in terms of revenue, about 59.6% in 2018. The leading segment, however, is advanced ceramics, mainly due to its biomedical applications <span>Asia Pacific was the region with the highest revenue, about 39.6% in 2018, driven by India and China mostly. Major players dominating the global scenario are AGC Ceramics Co.Ltd., Imerys Ceramics, Carbo Ceramics, Inc., 3M, Corning, and Kyocera Corporation.</span>Major players dominating the global scenario are AGC Ceramics Co.Ltd., Imerys Ceramics, Carbo Ceramics, Inc., 3M, Corning, and Kyocera Corporation.</p>
